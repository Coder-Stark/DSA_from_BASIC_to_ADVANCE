/*
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

/*
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.

Input: s = "aabacbebebe", k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: "cbebebe" is the longest substring with 3 distinct characters.

Input: s = "aaaa", k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There's no substring with 2 distinct characters.

Input: s = "aabaaab", k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: "aabaaab" is the longest substring with 2 distinct characters.
